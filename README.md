# Pizza-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard-SQL-Excel
This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL and presenting key business insights through an interactive Excel dashboard.

The raw sales data was stored in a relational database and analyzed using SQL queries to calculate important KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, total orders, pizzas sold, and average pizzas per order. Additional analysis was done to understand daily and hourly order trends, sales contribution by pizza category and size, and best and worst performing pizzas.

The processed data was then connected to Excel, where the final dashboard was built. The dashboard provides a clear visual view of sales performance, customer ordering behavior, peak business hours, and product-level insights using charts, KPIs, and slicers for easy filtering.
